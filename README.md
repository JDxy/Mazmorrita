# Mazmorrita

The Mazmorrita project is a game where you can create characters (up to a maximum of five), select weapons, and attacks.

Attacks will be loaded based on the type of character you create.

The classes that define the character type are: Mage, Rogue, Barbarian, each affecting the gameplay.

You can check and modify stats of the character like strength, defense, magic, mana, etc., and then access a floor where you can choose from different enemies to combat.

During combat, you can either win or lose battles. Winning grants you loot, specifically experience, and if you lose, the character dies and gets deleted, although it gives you the chance to start a new game and try again.
